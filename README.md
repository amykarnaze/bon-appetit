### Abstract
In this partner project, we created a recipe tracking and meal planning application. Users can favorite recipes, search for their favorited recipes by type, ingredient and tag and view individual reicpe details. If a user chooses to cook a recipe, they are able to view the needed ingredients to cook the recipe and the price of the missing ingredients.

The project utilized TDD with Mocha/Chai, HTML/CSS UX/UI design, array prototypes and implementatin of ES6 classes.

## SetUp

To view this application,
1) Clone down the repoitory button and copy the link, 'git clone (git@github.com:amykarnaze/bon-appetit.git').3. cd into the project
2) Once installed, run 'npm install'.
3) Run 'npm test' to see tests pass.
4) Type open index.html to see the site in action.
