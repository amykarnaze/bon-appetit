# Brief Description (Ex: Uses, Game Rules, Overview)
  In this partner project, we created a recipe tracking and meal planning application. Users can favorite recipes, serach their favorited recipes by type, ingredient and tag and view individual reicpes. If a user chooses to cook a recipe, they are able to view the needed ingredients to cook the recipe and the price of the missing ingredients.

  The project utilized TDD with Mocha/Chai, HTML/CSS UX/UI design, array prototypes, inplementatin of ES6 classes.
