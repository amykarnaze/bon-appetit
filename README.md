### Abstract

In this partner project, we created a recipe tracking and meal planning application. Users can favorite recipes, search for their favorited recipes by type, ingredient and tag and view individual reicpe details. If a user chooses to cook a recipe, they are able to view the needed ingredients to cook the recipe and the price of the missing ingredients.
The project utilized TDD with Mocha/Chai, HTML/CSS UX/UI design, array prototypes and implementatin of ES6 classes.
